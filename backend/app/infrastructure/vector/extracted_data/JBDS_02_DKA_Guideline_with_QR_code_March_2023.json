    "text": "When DKA does occur in end stage renal disease, several issues need to be considered. Fluid replacement The inability to develop an osmotic diuresis means that dialysis associated hyperglycaemia and ketosis can occur without much dehydration. A mixed picture of DKA and HHS may also occur because of the high serum tonicity (56). In addition, the circulating intravascular volume may increase at the expense of intracellular volume that resolves as the glucose and ketosis normalises. Therefore there may be no need for fluid replacement in those with end stage renal failure or those on dialysis. However, for those who are deemed hypovolaemic, aliquots of 250 ml (0.9% sodium chloride or 10% dextrose) may be given with frequent clinical assessments. For people with end stage renal failure or those on dialysis, insulin replacement is the mainstay of treatment. This should be given as a FRIII at an initial rate of 0.1 units/kg/hr, but may need to increase if the required rate of glucose fall is not achieved. However, the failure to renally clear insulin increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. However, the rate of glucose reduction is the same as for people with preserved renal function – i.e. 3.0 mmol/L/hour. If the rate of fall is faster, or the glucose falls to <14.0 mmol/L strongly consider reducing the rate of intravenous insulin infusion to 0.05 units/kg/hr.",
