    "text": "A systematic review of observational studies showed that the risk of limb ischemia and bleeding was less than 1% for radial catheters, and the risk of limb ischemia and bleeding was less than 1% and 1.58%, respectively for femoral catheters. The most common complication was localized hematoma, 14% for radial and 6% for femoral catheters. Ultrasound guidance may increase the first attempt success rate and decrease the complication rate. A systematic review showed higher risk of infections when femoral arterial catheters were used compared to radial artery catheters (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.32–2.84), and the overall pooled incidence of bloodstream infection was 0.96 per 1,000 catheter days. Arterial catheters should be removed as soon as continuous hemodynamic monitoring is no longer required to minimize the risk of complications. The prompt initiation of vasopressors to restore blood pressure is an integral component of the management of septic shock. Vasopressors have been traditionally administered via a central venous access due to concerns of extravasation, local tissue ischemia and injury if administered peripherally. However, the process of securing central venous access can be time consuming and requires specialized equipment and training that may not be available in under resourced settings even in high income countries, leading to a delayed initiation of vasopressors. A small study (n = 263) randomly allocated patients to receive peripheral vascular access or a central access. The need for vasopressor was the indication for venous access in 70% of the patients. The incidence of major catheter-related complications was higher in those randomized to peripheral venous lines with no significant difference in the incidence of minor catheter-related complication. The most common peripheral venous line complication was difficulty in placement. Almost half of the patients assigned to the peripheral venous line group required a second attempt at venous access. For adults with septic shock, we suggest using invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure over noninvasive monitoring, as soon as practical and if resources are available. For adults with septic shock, we suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured. When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa.",
