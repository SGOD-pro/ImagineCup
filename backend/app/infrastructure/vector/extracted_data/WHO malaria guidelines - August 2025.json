Clinical observations should be made as frequently as possible and should include monitoring of vital signs, coma score and urine output. Blood glucose should be monitored every 4 h, if possible, particularly in unconscious patients. Severe malaria is associated with a variety of manifestations and complications, which must be recognized promptly and treated as shown below.",
