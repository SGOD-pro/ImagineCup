Also give ORS (about 5 ml/kg body weight/hour) as soon as the child can drink: usually after 3-4 hours (infants) or 1–2 hours (children). Reassess an infant after 6 hours and a child after 3 hours. Classify dehydration. Then choose the appropriate plan (A, B, or C) to continue treatment. Assess child hourly. If not improving or dehydration is worse, increase drip rate. Do not stop the IV fluids until the child has been observed to retain the ORS for at least 1 hour and there is improvement in the clinical condition. Continue ORS on treatment plan B and continue to observe child until child has no signs of dehydration, then move to Plan A.

This ranges across the spectrum of neurological manifestations of TB: meningitis, tuberculomas, cord pathology. In various studies this has been shown to have a mortality rate of up to 25%. The following approach is presented for the diagnosis of paradoxical TB IRIS but the same principles apply to unmasking TB IRIS, as well as to IRIS related to other conditions. The starting point for a diagnosis is to think about IRIS in the first place. Have a high index of suspicion for IRIS in any patient developing new symptoms in the first few months of starting ART. There is no diagnostic test for IRIS, so once IRIS is being considered, diagnosis is made by running through this checklist: 1. Was the diagnosis of TB confirmed when TB treatment was initiated? 2. Was there initial improvement on TB treatment prior to starting ART? 3. Is the onset of new symptoms within 3 months of starting ART (typically within 1–3 weeks)? 4. Are there worsening signs and symptoms of TB? 5. Have I excluded other possible diagnoses? • DR TB* • Other OIs, including malignancy*.",

Prolonged IRIS is most commonly seen in lymph node IRIS, often with suppuration. The treatment is to aspirate peripheral lymph nodes to decrease pain or discomfort, sometimes repeatedly over several weeks or months. Prolonged steroids for up to 4 months may be necessary. Treatment of unmasking IRIS • Treat the opportunistic infection. • Continue ART; do not stop it. • Drain any collections. • Steroids may be used for prolonged, severe or neurological manifestations.

Follow-up viral loads after an elevated viral load should be done at 3 months along with adherence interventions. • Studies are increasingly showing that a substantial percentage of patients on EFV- or NVP-based regimens already have established resistance. A more rapid switch to a DTG-based regimen, after only one elevated VL, may well be appropriate, especially if the patient has been on such a regimen for more than a year and there is evidence of intermittent adherence. • Because of the higher morbidity and mortality risk, the need for a switch is augmented if there is a dropping CD4 count or any evidence of advanced HIV disease (AHD). Therefore, all patients should be screened for advanced HIV disease (AHD) at every visit and, in the presence of any of the criteria for AHD, a switch from an EFV- or NVP-based regimen should be done without any further VL testing (see chapter 11). • The threshold for diagnosing treatment failure is 1000 copies/ml but for viral suppression, it needs to be <50 copies/ml. A VL between 50 and 1000 copies/ml is termed a “low level viraemia” (LLV) and is associated with greater potential for future treatment failure. Attention to adherence should be given at every consultation to all patients but especially to those with any viral load above 50 copies/ml.",

Fluid replacement The inability to develop an osmotic diuresis means that dialysis associated hyperglycaemia and ketosis can occur without much dehydration. A mixed picture of DKA and HHS may also occur because of the high serum tonicity (56). In addition, the circulating intravascular volume may increase at the expense of intracellular volume that resolves as the glucose and ketosis normalises. Therefore there may be no need for fluid replacement in those with end stage renal failure or those on dialysis. However, for those who are deemed hypovolaemic, aliquots of 250 ml (0.9% sodium chloride or 10% dextrose) may be given with frequent clinical assessments. For people with end stage renal failure or those on dialysis, insulin replacement is the mainstay of treatment. This should be given as a FRIII at an initial rate of 0.1 units/kg/hr, but may need to increase if the required rate of glucose fall is not achieved. However, the failure to renally clear insulin increases the risk of hypoglycaemia. However, the rate of glucose reduction is the same as for people with preserved renal function – i.e. 3.0 mmol/L/hour. If the rate of fall is faster, or the glucose falls to <14.0 mmol/L strongly consider reducing the rate of intravenous insulin infusion to 0.05 units/kg/hr.",

The bi-directional association between undernutrition and TB leads to a high prevalence of undernutrition among people with TB. Proper TB treatment helps restore normal weight and nutrition. However, the time to full nutritional recovery can be long and many TB patients are still undernourished after TB treatment is completed. Proper nutritional care improves nutritional recovery for people who are undernourished, and therefore helps reduce future health risks.",

Undernutrition and tuberculosis (TB) are closely linked and both are public health problems. In TB, as in many other infectious diseases, there is a bidirectional interaction between nutritional status and active disease, undernutrition is associated with an increased frequency, severity and fatality of infections, including TB; while infections in turn lead to undernutrition. The association between TB and undernutrition has long been known. TB makes undernutrition worse and undernutrition weakens immunity, thereby increasing the likelihood that latent TB will develop into active disease. Most individuals with active TB are in a catabolic state and experience weight loss and some show signs of vitamin and mineral deficiencies at diagnosis. Weight loss among those with TB can be caused by several factors, including reduced food intake due to loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal pain; nutrient losses from vomiting and diarrhoea and metabolic alterations caused by the disease. Low body mass index (BMI) (lower than 18.5 kg/m2) and lack of adequate weight gain with TB treatment are associated with an increased risk of death and TB relapse and can be an indication of severity of TB, poor treatment response and/or the presence of other comorbid conditions. A weakened immune system - caused by malnutrition - can be quickly and easily corrected by just giving the body the nutrients it needs. Thus, nutritional intervention in combination with appropriate pharmaceutical therapy could improve the outcome in malnourished TB patients.",

The most common complication was localized hematoma, 14% for radial and 6% for femoral catheters. Ultrasound guidance may increase the first attempt success rate and decrease the complication rate. A systematic review showed higher risk of infections when femoral arterial catheters were used compared to radial artery catheters (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.32–2.84), and the overall pooled incidence of bloodstream infection was 0.96 per 1,000 catheter days. Arterial catheters should be removed as soon as continuous hemodynamic monitoring is no longer required to minimize the risk of complications. The prompt initiation of vasopressors to restore blood pressure is an integral component of the management of septic shock. Vasopressors have been traditionally administered via a central venous access due to concerns of extravasation, local tissue ischemia and injury if administered peripherally. However, the process of securing central venous access can be time consuming and requires specialized equipment and training that may not be available in under resourced settings even in high income countries, leading to a delayed initiation of vasopressors. A small study (n = 263) randomly allocated patients to receive peripheral vascular access or a central access. The need for vasopressor was the indication for venous access in 70% of the patients. The incidence of major catheter-related complications was higher in those randomized to peripheral venous lines with no significant difference in the incidence of minor catheter-related complication. The most common peripheral venous line complication was difficulty in placement. Almost half of the patients assigned to the peripheral venous line group required a second attempt at venous access. For adults with septic shock, we suggest using invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure over noninvasive monitoring, as soon as practical and if resources are available. For adults with septic shock, we suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured. When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa.",
