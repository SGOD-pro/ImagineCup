Reassess the child every 1-2 hours. If hydration status is not improving, give the IV fluid more rapidly than as stated in the Table for Plan B. Also give ORS (about 5 ml/kg body weight/hour) as soon as the child can drink: usually after 3-4 hours (infants) or 1–2 hours (children). Reassess an infant after 6 hours and a child after 3 hours. Classify dehydration. Then choose the appropriate plan (A, B, or C) to continue treatment. Assess child hourly. If not improving or dehydration is worse, increase drip rate. Do not stop the IV fluids until the child has been observed to retain the ORS for at least 1 hour and there is improvement in the clinical condition. Continue ORS on treatment plan B and continue to observe child until child has no signs of dehydration, then move to Plan A. If there is clinical and/or laboratory evidence of severe hypokalaemia, potassium should be given by the intravenous route using potassium chloride but only in a hospital.",
