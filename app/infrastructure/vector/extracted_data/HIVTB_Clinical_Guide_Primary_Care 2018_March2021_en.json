This ranges across the spectrum of neurological manifestations of TB: meningitis, tuberculomas, cord pathology. In various studies this has been shown to have a mortality rate of up to 25%. The following approach is presented for the diagnosis of paradoxical TB IRIS but the same principles apply to unmasking TB IRIS, as well as to IRIS related to other conditions. The starting point for a diagnosis is to think about IRIS in the first place. Have a high index of suspicion for IRIS in any patient developing new symptoms in the first few months of starting ART. There is no diagnostic test for IRIS, so once IRIS is being considered, diagnosis is made by running through this checklist: 1. Was the diagnosis of TB confirmed when TB treatment was initiated? 2. Was there initial improvement on TB treatment prior to starting ART? 3. Is the onset of new symptoms within 3 months of starting ART (typically within 1–3 weeks)? 4. Are there worsening signs and symptoms of TB? 5. Have I excluded other possible diagnoses? • DR TB* • Other OIs, including malignancy*.",

They have, however, not been shown to decrease mortality from IRIS. In these patients, steroids essentially make the patient feel more comfortable by treating the symptoms. Prolonged IRIS is most commonly seen in lymph node IRIS, often with suppuration. The treatment is to aspirate peripheral lymph nodes to decrease pain or discomfort, sometimes repeatedly over several weeks or months. Prolonged steroids for up to 4 months may be necessary. Treatment of unmasking IRIS • Treat the opportunistic infection. • Continue ART; do not stop it. • Drain any collections. • Steroids may be used for prolonged, severe or neurological manifestations. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, as there have been no randomised control trials for unmasking IRIS.",

Follow-up viral loads after an elevated viral load should be done at 3 months along with adherence interventions. • Studies are increasingly showing that a substantial percentage of patients on EFV- or NVP-based regimens already have established resistance. A more rapid switch to a DTG-based regimen, after only one elevated VL, may well be appropriate, especially if the patient has been on such a regimen for more than a year and there is evidence of intermittent adherence. • Because of the higher morbidity and mortality risk, the need for a switch is augmented if there is a dropping CD4 count or any evidence of advanced HIV disease (AHD). Therefore, all patients should be screened for advanced HIV disease (AHD) at every visit and, in the presence of any of the criteria for AHD, a switch from an EFV- or NVP-based regimen should be done without any further VL testing (see chapter 11). • The threshold for diagnosing treatment failure is 1000 copies/ml but for viral suppression, it needs to be <50 copies/ml. A VL between 50 and 1000 copies/ml is termed a “low level viraemia” (LLV) and is associated with greater potential for future treatment failure. Attention to adherence should be given at every consultation to all patients but especially to those with any viral load above 50 copies/ml.",
